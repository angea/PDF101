% Purpose of this file: Learn about the transformation matrix (CTM) operator `cm`.                        %
%         * The CTM manipulates the coordinate system of the user space canvas.                           %
%         * This allows for rotating, shifting, scaling and skewing graphical page objects.               %

% The CTM is a 3x3 matrix:    a  b  0                                                                           %

% Because the 3rd column is always "0 0 1" the PDF syntax takes the simplified approach of noting the CTM as an %
% array of 6 elements:  [a b c d e f].                                                                          %

% The `cm` operator concatenates the given matrix to the CTM (current transformation matrix). This means: it    %
% performs a mathematical matrix multiplication.                                                                %

% The resulting transformation matrix defines the method to compute the coordinates of the current user space   %
% (where the drawing commands are described) back to the original space (where the PDF viewer has to draw the   %
% pixels). If  x'  and y'  are to be the coordinates of the untransformed system, and  x  and  y  the ones for  %
% the transformed one, the equations are:                                                                       %

%     y'  =  b * x  +  d * y  + f                                                                               %

% The matrix represented by  [1 1 0 0 0 0]  does not change the coordinates ("unit" matrix). The final result   %
% of different consecutive transformations can be expressed by a single operation which is represented by a     %
% matrix that results from the matrix-multiplication of the individual matrices. (Matrix multiplication isn't   %
% commutativ -- just as coordination transformations cannot be swapped for identical results.) When a new       %
% coordination tranformation happens, the 'concatenation' (=multiplication) of the new matrix must be multi-    %
% plied *before* (that is: *pre-multiplied*!) the existing matrix.                                              %
