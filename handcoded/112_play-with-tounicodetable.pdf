% Purpose of this file: Learn some specifics about embedded fonts and also the 'ToUnicode' table.         %
%         * A 'ToUnicode' table must be present in the PDF in order to be able to extract/copy text.      %
%         * The '/Widths' array is there to set the 'trackings' of all glyphs in the font.                %
%         * Embedded fonts do not need to be 'complete' -- only 'glyphs' for used characters are required.%
